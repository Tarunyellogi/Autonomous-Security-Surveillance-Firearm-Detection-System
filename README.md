# Autonomous-Security-Surveillance-Firearm-Detection-System
An automated approach towards video surveillance system using Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning.


<h2>Introduction & Problem Statement:</h2>
Crowd information, for example, density, flow and behavior are a critical figure for arrangement, plan and administration of open 
offices subject to thick passerby movement. It is outstanding that regular manual estimation systems are not appropriate for complete 
information accumulation. This invokes that there is a need of an advanced approach to attain an autonomous Security and surveillance 
system. The System should be able to detect unauthorized persons and monitor crowd behavior thus aiding the human eye from continuous 
screen monitoring.
